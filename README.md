# 👀 more about me 👀

My name is Jhonatan Javier, I am a young Cuban programmer, who loves to create code, from a very young age the world of programming became part of my life, carrying out web projects and computer applications at a very young age, I have spent my whole life programming and reading the code, learning a little more every day, having in my mind the most real of all phrases of a programmer "If you can imagine it, you can create it"
